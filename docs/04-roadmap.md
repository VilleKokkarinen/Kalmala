# Roadmap

Each milestone must leave the project playable. Do not begin a later milestone while the earlier one fails its acceptance criteria.

## M0 — Bootstrap

Create the UE5 C++ project, source-control setup, module skeleton, default map, basic input, CI/build notes, and developer onboarding.

**Accept:** editor opens, a packaged development build launches, and a dedicated-server target can compile (or its exact setup blocker is documented).

## M1 — Networked traversal and interaction

Implement replicated character movement, camera, interaction trace, interactable interface, and a two-player test map.

**Accept:** host/client can join, move, and reliably interact with the same object; invalid client interaction is rejected server-side.

## M2 — Survival camp loop

Add server-owned inventory, harvesting, campfire warmth, basic crafting, placement preview, and three construction pieces.

**Accept:** two players can gather, craft, build, save/load a camp, and observe matching state after reconnect.

## M3 — Elemental world prototype

Build the bounded interaction grid, fire/wetness/temperature rules, and client visual feedback.

**Accept:** a torch lights dry wood, soaked wood resists, water extinguishes fire, and both clients observe equivalent outcomes.

## M4 — Combat and songcraft

Add combat attributes, damage execution, three enemy archetypes, one expedition, and ember/gust/binding abilities.

**Accept:** two players finish an expedition, use all verses, defeat all archetypes, and return a progression reward.

## M5 — Vertical-slice finish

Add original art/audio pass, tutorial beats, settings/accessibility, performance pass, balance, regression tests, packaging, and a dedicated-server playtest.

**Accept:** a new player can complete the documented 20–30 minute co-op loop without developer tools.
